He who seeks truth shall find beauty.

He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.

He who seeks order shall find gratification.

He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.

He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression.

He who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance.
